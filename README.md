## Project Description
## CougarsDomain

CougarsDomain is a project designed to allow students to create and customize their own characters to battle through waves of bosses. Each wave presents unique challenges, culminating in a final boss who is inspired by one of the WSU Vancouver CS professors—reimagined as an animal! 🐾

### Future Updates Will Include:
- Additional character customization options.
- A variety of bosses, each with unique abilities and animal designs.
- New weapons, skills, and power-ups to aid players in their battles.
- Enhanced graphics and animations for a more immersive experience.
- Online leaderboards to track high scores and compete with friends.
